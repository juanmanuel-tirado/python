    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the second part of our analysis of how air traffic may have contributed to spread the Covid19 virus. In the previous part, we did a visual analysis of the OpenFlights dataset and showed how to plot geo data with Plotly. Then, we run a first intro to graph-tool and SIR modelling. In this part, we use tools such as Numpy, Pandas, Plotly, and [graph-tool](graph-tool.skewed.de) to run our own SIR pandemic model and learn how to leverage available data to improve our graph based models.\n",

    "**Note:** we assume you are familiar with the previous part of this notebook. If not, please check it out before continuing.\n",

    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The [OpenFlights](https://openflights.org/data.html) dataset contains airlines, air routes and airports per country. The information contained in the dataset is up to 2014. This may be a bit outdated. However, it is detailed enough for our purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we use the [Kraggle Covid19 challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-2) data as we did in our previous Covid19 series."

    "The [SIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology) model is a simple, yet powerful, compartimental model for epidemics. The model consists of three compartments $S$, $I$ and $R$. $S$ is the number of susceptible, $I$ the number of infectuous and $R$ the number of recovered or deceased individuals. This is the most common model used right now and has many extensions and enhancements. The number of individuals in $S$ falls down as they become infected ($I$) and then recovered $R$. This is one of the famous infection curves used to forecast Covid19 evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is particularly suitable for graphs. Edges determine transmission channels to propagate a contagious entity. Vertices transitions between the different compartments modeling the behaviour of pandemics. Using our graph, we assume that air traffic is a potential channel for contagious actors. The larger number of flights between two countries, the higher probabilities of a country to become infected.\n",

    "We create a helping function called `runSIR` that iterates the SIR model and collects information in a Pandas dataframe. Before that, we add a susceptible vertex property and a beta property to our graphs. The first property, is set to 0 for all the vertices but the root in the pandemia, in this case China. The beta property is a probability computed by dividing $W(E)$ by the total number of outgoing flights for the source vertex of $E$."

    "The histogram above shows the temporal distance for the countries to get infected in our four scenarios. The temporal distance is the difference between the day a country declared at least one infected and the day this country appears as infected in our simulations. Positive distances indicate that our simulations predicted an infection later than it was observed. And the other way around, negative distances indicate predictions before the infection was observed.\n",

    "In this notebook, we have explored how we can enhance a network dissemination model with SIR and air traffic data. Our results, far from being perfect, demonstrate how networks enhanced with additional data can improve dissemination models. In particular, we demonstrate that using air traffic data may have a relevant impact in the understanding and performance of existing Covid19 models. \n",
